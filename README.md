## About The Project
This project started by me for education purposes. I started this project to improve my skills and learn more technologies. The most skill I wanted to improve was testing skill. And so I very tired to write a lot of tests for services, endpoints and utils stuff. I understand that it isn't at least 90% coverage, far from it and some tests are unnecessary, or I didn't write some necessary tests. I tried to stick to TDD approach and tried this approach on this project and received a lot of experience. And the second technology I wanted to explore more is async technology, and so I chose FastAPI as webframework and SQLAlchemy as ORM. I very like FasrtAPI because of its flexibility and opportunities (like dependency injection, pydantic compatibility and other wonderful out-of-the-box stuff) and so I chose FastAPI instead aiohttp's server api. And more I learn more about SQLAlchemy and used more of its asyncio core api and learned little more SQL then "select from".
I didn't take this project to complete (far away) and I leave in this project a lot of to do.
